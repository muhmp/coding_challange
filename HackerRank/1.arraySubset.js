/**
 *: Array Subsets Given an integer array, the values of the array need to be 
 separated into two subsets A and B whose intersection is null and whose union 
 is the entire array. The sum of values in set A must be strictly greater than 
 the sum of values in set B, and the number of elements in set A must be minimal. 
 Return the values in set A in increasing order. If there are multiple sets that 
 are possible solutions, return that set that has maximum total sum of all its 
 elements. 
 
 
 For example, given arr = [3,7, 5, 6, 2] the divisions with the minimal 
    2 elements in subset A are [5,7]and [6, 7]. of the two candidates. [6,7] sums 
    to the higher amount. 
    
    
Function Description:  Complete the subsetA function in 
    the editor below. The function must return an integer array denoting the 
    subset A 
    
subset has the following parameter(s): 
    arr int[]: an integer array 
    
Constraints . 
    1 <= n <= 10^5
